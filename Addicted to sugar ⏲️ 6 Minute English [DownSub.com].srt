00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,520
Hello. This is 6 Minute
English from BBC Learning English.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,240
I'm Neil and I'm Georgie.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,800
Would you like a cup of tea, Neil?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,840
Oh, yes thanks Georgie, with milk
and three sugars, please.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,680
Three sugars, wow!

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
You really have a sweet tooth -

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,360
you like eating sweet things.
Aren't you worried about your weight?

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,960
Yes, but I can't say no to sugar.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
Just as our addiction to oil
is causing a climate emergency,

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,080
our addiction to sugar
is causing a health emergency

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,920
for our bodies. Sugar gives us an
instant hit at the chemical hormone

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,360
dopamine making us feel good,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,360
but in the long run causing obesity,
tooth decay and diseases like diabetes.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,760
But how did our addiction
to the sweet stuff begin?

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,120
That's what we'll be discussing
in this programme.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,480
And as usual,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,800
we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
Anyway, here's your tea, Neil.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,080
I just put one sugar.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,200
Thanks, Georgie,
I'll give it a try.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,400
Now, before we go on,

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,200
I have a question for you. Sugar cane,
which grows naturally in Asia, Africa

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,560
and the Americas first came
to England in the 11th century.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,240
Back then it was an expensive luxury
item affordable only to kings, queens

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,760
and the very rich.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,240
So, which English monarch loved eating
sugar so much their teeth turned black?

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,720
Was it a) King Henry VIII b)
Queen Elizabeth I

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,320
or c) Mary Queen of Scots?

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,760
I know Henry VIII was very unhealthy

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,600
so I'll guess it's him.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,640
OK, Georgie. We'll find out
the answer later in the programme.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Just now, I compared sugar to oil as
the world's most important commodity -

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,040
a commodity is a product or
natural resource that can be traded,

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,520
bought and sold. Today,

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,800
economies, governments and wars
are based on controlling oil,

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,320
but in earlier centuries,
the same was true of sugar.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,720
For 400 years sugar,

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,520
along with coffee and tobacco,
was grown in slavery plantations

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,000
and shipped across the
Atlantic Ocean to Europe.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,400
By the time slavery
was ended in 1834,

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,360
the demand for sugar in Europe and
the United States was at a record high.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,880
Here's Professor
of international history Ulbe Bosma

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,920
explaining more to BBC Radio 4
programme 'Thinking Allowed':

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
Sugar was already an extremely
important commodity

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,960
in the 16th and 17th and 18th century,

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
and in the 19th century

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,120
we see a staggering growth of sugar
consumption in Europe and United States

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,600
and so with that sugar became
the fuel for human bodies whereas

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,760
oil became the fuel for vehicles
in the 20th century.

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
Professor Bosma talks

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,240
about the staggering growth
in the popularity of sugar.

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,200
The adjective 'staggering'
means shocking or surprising. Just

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,360
like oil became the fuel for machine

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,840
engines, sugar became the fuel
for the human body.

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
Fuel is a substance that is burned
to provide heat or power

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,640
Trading companies had become rich
selling sugar grown using slave labour.

57
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,720
When people began to realise
the health problems of sugar

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,440
in the 20th century,

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,000
these companies needed
new ways to sell their product

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,120
and began using sugar in food
which had previously contained none,

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,320
food like bread, cereal and yoghurt.

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,520
Here's Professor Bosma again,
taking up the story for BBC

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Radio 4's 'Thinking Allowed'.

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400
You can flood the market with a certain
commodity, with sugar in this case,

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,480
but that still does not mean that
people will consume it.

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,560
So the eating habits
of people had to change. People

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,120
until the early 19th century,
they had a few spoons of sugar per week,

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,520
but not a kilo, which people consume
today in many countries in the world.

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Sugar companies flooded
the market with their commodity.

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,440
If you flood the market,

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,040
you make a lot of your product available
for sale, often at a low price.

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,760
But just because something is cheap
and easily available, doesn't mean

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
people will eat it. So, sugar

74
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,680
companies tried
to increase sugar consumption

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,360
by changing people's eating habits -

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,800
the way a group of people eat,

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
for example, which types of food

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,200
they eat, how much of it,
and how often.

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,240
Instead of one or two spoons
of sugar per week,

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,680
people started eating kilos, with results
we see around us every day - worldwide

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,680
obesity and heart disease
have tripled in the last 50 years.

82
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,320
What's more because
sugary food is cheaper,

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,360
it's often the poorest in society
who are worst affected.

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
Hmm, maybe it's time to try having
your tea without any sugar

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
eh, Neil? And to reveal the answer
to your question:

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,440
which English monarch's famous love
of sugar turned their teeth black?

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,120
I guessed it was the
notorious overeater, Henry VIII.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,440
Which was the wrong answer.
I'm afraid, Georgie.

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
In fact, during the years
before toothpaste and dentists,

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,160
those black stumpy teeth belonged
to Queen Elizabeth I.

91
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,000
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,800
we've learned from this programme
about sugar, starting

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,880
with 'a sweet tooth' - a fondness for
eating sweet, sugary food and drinks.

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,480
A commodity is a product or
natural resource that can be traded,

95
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,440
bought and sold.
Fuel is a substance such as oil or coal

96
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,360
that is burned
to provide heat or power.

97
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,240
The adjective 'staggering' means
very shocking and surprising.

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
If a company floods the market,
they release a lot

99
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,000
of a particular product for sale,
often at a low price.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,920
And finally, eating habits

101
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,960
describe the way
a particular group of people eat,

102
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
for example, which types of food

103
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,720
they eat, how much
and how often.
